      "3. **Blue Kryptonite**: This type affects Bizarro, the imperfect clone of Superman, in the same way that Green Kryptonite affects normal Kryptonians. It can neutralize the powers of Bizarros and, in some versions, affects Kryptonians with different effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Gold Kryptonite**: This form can permanently remove a Kryptonian's superpowers, essentially making them normal without any abilities.\n",

      "7. **Silver Kryptonite**: Typically introduced as a hoax or hallucinogen in certain storylines, Silver Kryptonite can cause extreme paranoia and hallucinations in Kryptonians.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Jewel Kryptonite**: This is a rare form that enhances the psychic abilities of those in the Phantom Zone, allowing them to project their influence into the material world.\n",

      "Elara felt as if the statue invited her to share in some forgotten joy. Fascinated, she visited the garden regularly, enchanted by its tranquility and the statue's silent companionship. Little did she know, generations of villagers had whispered about magical tales of a joyful spirit inhabiting these woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "As weeks turned into months, Elara noticed small wild animals seemed to follow her in content harmony whenever she approached the hidden haven. Birds would gather on her steps, and rabbits bounded alongside her, filling the air with a gentle energy and companionship she had never known.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, Elara entered the garden to find the statue unexpectedly missing. In its place sprouted a beautiful flowering tree, vibrant with bright canary blossoms that mirror the sunshine itself. She realized then that she had never been alone; the spirit of joy had always been with her, teaching her the true essence of companionship and contentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elara grew, she carried the garden's lessons forever in her heart, cherishing trails of happiness wherever she went. The enchanting oak-guarded glade remained a cherished secret, with the flowers serving as a yearly reminder that friendship transcends the barriers we can see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generations later, Eldergrove hummed with legends of Elara and her magical friendship, each storyteller gazing toward the enthusiastically blooming canary tree, believing they, too, were part of its ever-blossoming mystery and joy.\n"
