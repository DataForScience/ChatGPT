      "1. **Green Kryptonite**: The classic form that weakens and can potentially kill Superman and other Kryptonians with prolonged exposure.\n",

      "2. **Red Kryptonite**: Causes bizarre and unpredictable effects on Kryptonians. The specific effect can vary with each exposure, including physical transformations, changes in personality, or temporary powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Blue Kryptonite**: Typically affects Bizarro, the imperfect clone of Superman, in much the same way that Green Kryptonite affects Superman. In some instances, it can also have calming effects on Kryptonians with certain conditions.\n",

      "4. **Gold Kryptonite**: Permanently removes a Kryptonian's superpowers, essentially making them human.\n",

      "5. **White Kryptonite**: Lethal to all plant life, both on Earth and Krypton, but does not affect animal life.\n",

      "\n",
      "8. **Jewel Kryptonite**: Has been presented as amplifying psychic abilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Pink Kryptonite**: Causes bizarre, often humorous gender-bending or stereotypical behavior in Superman, typically used in non-canon, tongue-in-cheek stories.\n",

Here are some of the different types of Kryptonite:\n",

      "3. **Blue Kryptonite**: This affects Bizarro, Superman's imperfect clone, in a similar way that green Kryptonite affects Superman, rendering Bizarro weak and powerless.\n",

      "7. **Silver Kryptonite**: Introduced in the TV series \"Smallville,\" silver Kryptonite causes extreme paranoia and hallucinations in Kryptonians.\n",
